## üìã Overview

A microservices application for managing customers and products in an e-commerce platform built with modern technologies. This project demonstrates architectural patterns for scalable backend systems using message-based communication.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of three microservices:

- **API Gateway** ‚Äî HTTP API that handles external requests and orchestrates inter-service communication
- **Customers Service** ‚Äî Manages customer data with its dedicated MySQL database
- **Products Service** ‚Äî Handles product information with its dedicated MySQL database

Communication between services is implemented via Redis as a message broker, following event-driven architecture patterns.

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Backend Framework**: NestJS
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Message Broker**: Redis
- **Databases**: MySQL
- **API Style**: RESTful
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **ORM**: Prisma

## üóÑÔ∏è Why I Chose Separate Databases for Each Service

I decided to give each microservice (Customers and Products) its own dedicated MySQL database. Here‚Äôs why I believe this is the right approach for this project:

- **Loose Coupling:** Services don‚Äôt share database schemas or direct access, which keeps their domains clearly separated and independent.
- **Security & Privacy:** Customer data often contains sensitive, personally identifiable information (personenbezogene Daten). By isolating this data in its own database, I can reduce the risk of accidental exposure and apply stricter access controls, which is important for privacy regulations like GDPR.
- **Scalability:** Each service can scale, migrate, or optimize its database independently, without affecting the others.
- **Autonomy:** Teams can evolve their services and database schemas without coordination overhead or risk of breaking other services.
- **Failure Isolation:** Problems in one database (like corruption or migration errors) won‚Äôt directly impact the other service.

Also, the services communicate **only via the message broker (Redis)** and have no direct knowledge of each other‚Äôs internal data structures or storage. This further enforces the microservices principle of independent, decoupled components.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (for local development only)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bumbaRasch/css_ecommerce.git
cd css_ecommerce
```

2. **Copy `.env.example`**

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

3. **Start all services**

This will start all services, databases, Redis, and Adminer for DB inspection.

- To start all services with logs:

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

- To start all services in detached mode (without logs):

```sh
docker-compose up --build -d
```

4. **Seed data**

To generate test data, use the following commands:
Where <number> is the number of records to create (e.g., 10).

Create customers

```sh
docker compose exec customers-service npm run seed:customers -- <number>
```

Create products

```sh
docker compose exec products-service npm run seed:products -- <number>
```

### üì° API Endpoints

| Endpoint             | Method | Description                               |
| -------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `/api/customers`     | GET    | Retrieve all customers                    |
| `/api/customers/:id` | GET    | Get customer by ID with favorite products |

### üìù API Documentation (Swagger)

Interactive API documentation is available via Swagger UI:

- [http://localhost:3000/api/docs](http://localhost:3000/api/docs)

You can explore all endpoints, view request/response schemas, and try out requests directly from your browser.

### Check API

The API is available at: http://localhost:3000/api/customers

- Get all customers:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/api/customers
```

- Get a customer with "favorite" products:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/api/customers/1
```

  ]
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The application uses environment variables defined in `.env` file:

### Database Configuration

- `MYSQL_CUSTOMERS_URL`: Connection string for customers database
- `MYSQL_PRODUCTS_URL`: Connection string for products database

### Redis Configuration

- `REDIS_HOST`: Redis server hostname
- `REDIS_PORT`: Redis server port
- `REDIS_PASSWORD`: Redis authentication password

### Application Settings

- `API_GATEWAY_PORT`: Port for the API Gateway service
- `FAVORITE_PRODUCTS_COUNT`: Number of random products to include

## üõ° Error Handling

The application implements the following error handling strategies:

- **Not Found errors**: 404 responses for non-existent resources
